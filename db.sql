'yartt — a task tracker without projects, subtasks or assignments.


============================================================================
PHILOSOPHY
============================================================================

yartt is a task tracker without projects and subtasks. Flexible clustering
through tags, links through a dependency graph, responsibility through
ownership.

Key principles:
  - No projects. Flexible clustering through tags.
  - No task titles. The set of tags is the task "title": nobody has to
    agree on a title format, and searching by tags keeps their variety
    under control.
  - No subtasks. Links go through dependency — a directed graph.
  - No assignments. The task owner (the author becomes the owner) is
    responsible for getting it done on time and well thought out. The
    owner directs other employees within the task like a project manager,
    or works alone if nobody else is needed.
  - Access is defined by task visibility (observer).
  - A task is private while it has active observers: only they see it.
    The owner of a private task is always an observer. The manager
    (recursively up manager_id) is automatically added as an observer to
    every task of their reports.
  - A task with no active observers is public: every employee sees it.
    The owner makes a task public (all observers go) and private again.
  - The header of any task — tags, priority, deadline — is visible to
    every employee, so a person can tell whether to ask for access. The
    context, comments and people are visible only to those who see the
    task. Only the owner changes the header and the context.
  - All work happens in comments.
  - Comments are never deleted or hidden. If a comment is outdated, reply
    to it (reply_to_id) and say so.
  - A task cannot be deleted. A task is closed only by its owner, who
    confirms it (close_task()): a passed deadline does not close it, it
    makes the task overdue — still open, in its owner''s "Waiting for me"
    until they close it or move the deadline (decision 93). The owner can
    move finished_at (later or earlier) or clear it — owners of dependent
    tasks are notified; a moved deadline opens a closed task again.
  - A task has an owner (owner_id). There is no separate creator role.
  - Ownership can be transferred by the owner or by the owner''s direct
    manager. The previous owner stays an observer. When the owner is
    dismissed, their tasks go to their manager. With no manager the task
    is left without an owner and any observer can take it.
  - Observers see the task and change only their own things: comments,
    their time entries, their time left, their reminders, their mentions —
    and bring others in, the way a copy is added to an email. The owner
    keeps the rest of access: removes observers, answers requests and
    makes the task public or private. A mention in a private task
    addresses only its observers; anyone else is brought in by a
    participant or asks for access.
  - Access is revoked explicitly: an observer can leave, the owner can
    remove an observer. There is also an access request flow: an employee
    files a request (added_at = NULL), the owner is notified and approves
    it (added_at = NOW()) or rejects it (deleted_at = NOW()). Opening and
    closing someone''s access is notified to them.
  - The deadline (finished_at) lives in an interval table. The current
    value = expired_at IS NULL. Clearing = closing the active row without
    opening a new one.
  - A dependency may carry the latest deadline of the task waited for that
    the waiting task can live with (latest_at). Nothing is forbidden by
    it: when the deadline waited for is later, or there is none, both
    tasks are at risk (at_risk()) — the waiting one is late because of
    the other, the other delays it — and the owner of the waiting task is
    told as the deadline moves.
  - Anyone sets limits of hours on a combination of tags for a fixed
    period (tag_limit): how much they and everyone under them may spend
    on it. A task under several limits counts in each. A limit is never
    edited: a change closes it and opens a new one, so its history is
    kept. It warns, it forbids nothing.
  - Work quality is scored only per employee per day, never per task.
    The current manager (employee.manager_id) scores any past day with a
    filled timesheet. Scores are optional: the manager decides which days
    to score, if any. After the first score neither the timesheet nor
    the time entries of that day can change. The score itself can be
    corrected by the current manager; every version (value, reason, time
    and the previous value) is emailed to the employee — the mail is the
    history, the table keeps only the current value.
  - The timesheet and time entries are optional too: they are kept when the
    manager asks for them.
  - Workload comes from the timesheet (work). Quality and workload are
    kept apart. A bonus is the manager''s decision; the system provides
    both metrics.
  - The timesheet only moves forward: a closed shift cannot be changed
    or deleted. People think when closing a shift instead of editing it
    afterwards.
  - While a person is away (human.next_day in the future),
    notifications go both to them and to their manager (recursively up
    manager_id until an available manager is found).
  - Notifications are a queue in the database. The worker delivers them
    by email (SMTP from the configuration) and/or to an outgoing webhook
    for other channels (sent_at); the user handles a notification
    (closed_at). Cleaned up after a year.
  - Comments are never edited. The interface protects against accidental
    sending: a sent comment can be pulled back into editing for a few
    seconds and only then goes to the server.
  - Attachments live in a separate table, deduplicated by hash; a file is
    kept while someone holds it in their quota. A comment refers to them
    by an array of ids.
  - Reminders (remind) are explicit: an employee decides when to be
    reminded about a task. Once due it waits in their "Waiting for me"
    until they remove it or move it.
  - Only an employee can create another employee (an invite). The first
    employee is created by the application on its first start, and is
    greeted with a link to sign in (welcome), as is anyone the
    installation''s administrator adds outside the API. No roles:
    rights come from relationships. Only the direct manager can dismiss an
    employee or bring them back.
  - An employee is a person or a bot. A bot is a program — CI,
    monitoring — that owns tasks, comments and is mentioned like a
    person, through the API with its key, within permissions that only
    narrow what its relationships allow. It has no timesheet, time or
    scores and manages nobody. Its manager — whoever created it or got it
    handed over — runs it; its notifications go to its own webhook.
  - Visits are logged: opening a task or any other screen. They show the
    owner who looked at a task and help to suggest when a shift started
    and ended.
  - One database — one company. No multi-tenancy.


============================================================================
WHY WE DROP THE USUAL CONSTRUCTS
============================================================================

From projects to tags.
  The problem with projects: a rigid hierarchy. A task belongs to one
  project. To share one task you have to share the whole project or
  build ACLs. To reclassify a task you have to move it, which breaks
  links and reports.
  What we do: tags are free clustering. A task can have several tags.
  Tags are labels, not folders. Access to a task is separate from tags.
  The set of tags is unique and serves as the task title. There is no
  "belongs to a project" — a task exists on its own.

From titles to sets of tags.
  The problem with titles: everyone words them differently, one task is
  called five ways, free-text search is weak.
  What we do: title = a unique set of tags. New tags appear, but
  searching through existing ones keeps the vocabulary compact.

From subtasks to dependencies.
  The problem with subtasks: a hierarchy. Parent and child. A parent
  cannot be closed while a child is open. Deep nesting. "Zombie parents"
  (all children closed, the parent hangs).
  What we do: a directed dependency graph. A depends on B — A cannot be
  considered done until B is done. But B is not part of A. It is a
  separate task with its own owner. No "levels", only a network. Cycles
  and self-dependencies are forbidden.

From assignments to ownership.
  The problem with assignments: a manager gives a task to an assignee.
  The assignee does it. The manager checks. A "done / not done"
  argument. Double responsibility. A task "hangs" on an assignee who
  cannot close it. Or the assignee "closed" it and the manager disagrees.
  What we do: the task owner is responsible for the result. The owner is
  the author of the idea and the one in charge. They work alone or bring
  others in. The others are observers: they log time, comment, plan, but
  are not responsible for the result. Ownership can be transferred. Only
  the owner closes the task, by confirming it; a deadline that arrives
  only makes it overdue.

From scoring tasks to scoring people per day.
  The problem with scoring tasks: a task lasts months and ten people work
  on it — what do you score? Whom do you blame? Unclear. A "bad" or
  "good" score is subjective and vague. Gaming: close faster to avoid
  being late, or drag it out to look "hard".
  What we do: the manager scores a person''s day, 0–100%. The score is
  about the quality of the day''s decisions: did the person pick the
  right priorities, do their decisions match the manager''s
  understanding. Not about the task result. A task may fail while the
  scores are good if the person chose well every day — then the problem
  is in priorities, plans or the manager, not in the person. Weighted by
  timesheet hours.

From created_by to owner_id.
  The problem with created_by: the creator is a role without
  responsibility. "I created it, but it is not mine." Responsibility
  blurs.
  What we do: owner_id. Creator = owner. No separate "author" role.
  Ownership can be transferred. No "who created it" history — not
  needed. Creation is not a metric. Lead time / cycle time are easy to
  game (create only "quick" tasks). created_at is not stored at all.

From deleting to closing.
  The problem with deleting: delete it and the data is gone. Metrics
  drift. History is lost. Links break.
  What we do: a task cannot be deleted (trigger). finished_at can be
  set, cleared (the task is back in progress) or moved. A task is closed
  when its owner confirms it; one whose deadline passed unconfirmed is
  overdue — a signal: "missed it and did not warn".

From watching a person to requesting access.
  The problem with observer_link: A "watches" B and sees all of B''s
  tasks. Cognitive load. "I followed Pete — now there are 200 tasks in
  my feed."
  What we do: access is per task. Want to see it — ask, or get added.
  A manager is automatically added to every task of their reports (down
  the hierarchy).

From a notification inbox to a queue.
  The problem with an inbox: "1000 unread". Nobody reads them. They lose
  meaning.
  What we do: notification is a queue. A notification goes to the
  webhook, the user handles it (closed_at). Cleaned up after a year.
  Reminders (remind) are explicit: an employee sets them; a due one
  waits for them until removed or moved.

From deleting comments to "they live forever".
  The problem with deleting: delete it and the context is lost. Replies
  dangle. Links break.
  What we do: comments are never deleted or hidden (trigger). If a
  comment is outdated, reply to it (reply_to_id) and say so.
  reply_to_id is the parent''s local id.

From parsing @username to attachments.
  Employees (mention) and tasks (task_mention) are attached to a comment
  explicitly. No text parsing.


============================================================================
SEARCH
============================================================================

  - By tags: autocomplete forgiving typos, transliteration and the wrong
    keyboard layout. Every tag keeps its name in Latin letters
    (tag.latin); the typed text, and the same keys read with each other
    layout of the person (human.keyboards; the layouts themselves are
    in the application), are transliterated the same way and compared
    with Levenshtein and trigrams. Comparing in Latin also keeps trigrams
    working when the database locale is C, where pg_trgm ignores non-ASCII
    letters. Candidates are picked by the indexes on tag.latin first — the
    nearest by trigrams (GiST, KNN), the exact name, names starting with
    the word — so the cost does not grow with every tag.
    Then tasks WHERE tag_ids @> ARRAY[...] (GIN).
  - By text: task.context and comment.value with ILIKE / similarity
    (trigrams work for any language and for substrings).


============================================================================
TASK IDENTIFIERS
============================================================================

  - task.id — SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, immutable. All FKs and URLs use it.
  - task.tag_ids — the set of tags, stored sorted (trigger).
    UNIQUE: two tasks with the same set of tags are impossible.
    On a conflict the application asks to add a tag.
  - Tags cannot be empty (at least one tag).
  - Duplicate tags are forbidden. All tags must exist.


============================================================================
AUTHENTICATION
============================================================================

  - The email token (token) is single-use and lives 10 minutes.
  - The session token (session) is long-lived: 30 days of inactivity.
  - The database stores only SHA-256 of the tokens. Tokens are 32 random
    bytes, so no salt is needed. A database leak (backup, replica,
    read-only SQL injection) does not let anyone sign in.
  - Issuing and checking tokens — functions issue_token, login,
    authenticate.


============================================================================
OPERATIONS
============================================================================
What the application must be able to do. No URLs — they are defined when
the API is implemented.

  Authentication:
    - With the company''s identity provider configured (OIDC), only through
      it: the provider''s answer -> sign_in_external(); someone it lets in
      for the first time confirms their email by a link opened in the same
      browser (begin_external_sign_in(), send_external_email(),
      confirm_external_email()); no sign-in links, no invites (people come
      in by signing in).
    - Otherwise: request sign-in by email -> issue_token(), send the link through the
      webhook directly (not through notification — the token must not lie
      in the database in plain text).
    - Follow the link from the email -> login(), set the cookie.
    - Every request -> authenticate().
    - Log out -> deletes the session.
    - Log out everywhere -> deletes all sessions of the employee.

  Employees:
    - Invite an employee (any employee: email, full_name, locale)
      -> notify(kind = invite).
    - Edit the profile (full_name, about, next_day, time_zone, locale).
    - Change one''s email -> request_email_change(), the link goes by email
      to the new address only; following it -> confirm_email_change().

  Bots:
    - Create a bot (create_bot: any person, under themselves).
    - Change its name, pronoun, about, permissions, webhook (its direct
      manager, check_bot_manager).
    - Replace its key (reset_bot_key: its direct manager).
    - Hand it to another person (transfer_bot: its direct manager).
    - Dismiss / bring back — like anyone, by its direct manager.
    - Every API request with a key -> authenticate_bot().
    - Set / change manager_id (the employee themselves).
    - Dismiss an employee (dismiss_employee: the direct manager).
    - Bring a dismissed employee back (restore_employee: the direct manager).

  Visits:
    - Open a task / any other screen -> log_visit().

  Tasks:
    - Create a task (owner = creator, tags, priority).
    - Change tag_ids / priority / context (owner only).
    - "No intervention needed" (mark_reviewed: owner only, not while an
      access request waits): takes away the review notices up to the
      newest one shown (decision 94). It never closes the task.
    - Make public / private (make_public / make_private: owner only).
    - Transfer ownership (the owner or the owner''s manager).
    - Take an ownerless task (owner_id IS NULL, any observer).

  Access:
    - Add an observer or bring one back (add_observer: any participant).
    - Request access (request_access: the employee themselves).
    - Withdraw one''s own request (withdraw_access).
    - Approve a request (approve_access: the owner).
    - Reject a request (reject_access: the owner).
    - Remove an observer (remove_observer: the owner).
    - Leave a task (leave_task: the observer themselves, except the owner
      and the manager of an observing report).

  Dependencies:
    - Add a dependency — an existing task or one created with it (anyone
      who sees both tasks, the same from either side; the owners of both,
      other than whoever added it, are notified).
    - Set / change its latest deadline (owner of task_id only).
    - Remove a dependency (owner of task_id, or whoever added it).

  Deadlines:
    - Set / move finished_at (set_finished_at, owner only).
    - Clear finished_at (clear_finished_at, owner only).
    - Close a task (close_task: owner only, not while someone still has
      time planned on it): an open one is closed now, an overdue one at
      its passed deadline; the tasks waiting for it are done for from
      then on (dependency.done_at).
    - Take note that a task waited for is done (mark_reviewed of the
      waiting task, or close_task with it).

  Time left:
    - Set / change / clear estimate_minutes for oneself (anyone who sees
      the task).

  Time entries:
    - Set one''s time on a task for a day (anyone who sees the task): the
      day''s whole time, replacing what was there; 0 removes the entry.

  Timesheet:
    - Open a shift (started_at = NOW, spent_minutes = NULL).
    - Change the open shift (started_at, about).
    - Close a shift (spent_minutes = N, about = text).
    - Delete the open shift.
    - Closed shifts are immutable.

  Comments:
    - Upload an attachment (deduplicated by hash; refused over the size
      and quota limits; the same bytes restore a purged one) -> attachment.id.
    - Keep a file one sees in a task (keep_attachment); let a file one
      holds go (release_attachment) — the last one to let it go deletes
      its content.
    - Leave a comment (with attachment_ids and image_ids) — anyone who
      sees the task.
    - Reply to a comment (reply_to_id).
    - Attach an employee -> mention.
    - Attach a task -> task_mention.

  Mentions:
    - Close a mention (closed_at = NOW, explicitly, by the mentioned employee).

  Reminders:
    - Set a remind (an observer).
    - Move a remind to a later moment (its author): due again then.
    - Delete a remind (its author).

  Notifications:
    - Close a notification (closed_at = NOW).

  Scores:
    - Score an employee''s past day or correct the score (the current
      manager; every version is notified to the employee).


============================================================================
ACCESS RULES
============================================================================

  Task:
    - priority, tag_ids, context — owner only.
    - reviewed_at — owner only.
    - owner_id — the current owner or the owner''s direct manager.
    - finished_at — owner only.
    - dependency — added by anyone who sees both task_id and value; latest_at
      by the owner of task_id only; removed by the owner of task_id or
      whoever added it (decision 94).

  Seeing a task (can_see):
    - The header (tag_ids, priority, finished_at, owner) — everyone.
    - The rest (context, comments, people, time) — the active observers
      of a private task; everyone for a public task.

  Observers:
    - Add or bring back an observer — any participant of a private task
      (like a copy in an email); remove — owner only.
    - Make the task public / private — owner only.
    - Any employee can request access to a private task.
    - Approve / reject a request — owner only.
    - Leave a task — the observer themselves. The owner cannot leave.
    - A manager cannot be removed (and cannot leave) while a report of
      theirs (recursively) observes the task.

  Time left and time entries:
    - estimate_minutes — anyone who sees the task, for themselves only.
    - spent_minutes — anyone who sees the task, for themselves only.
    - remind — anyone who sees the task, for themselves only.
    - work — the employee themselves (their own shift).

  Comments:
    - Leave a comment — anyone who sees the task.
    - Attach an employee or a task — anyone who sees the task.
    - A private task: only an active observer can be attached (mentioned).
      A public task: any active employee can be attached.

  Scores:
    - score — only the current manager (employee.manager_id).

  Bots:
    - Create — any person, under themselves.
    - Change, replace the key, hand over, dismiss, bring back — its
      direct manager only.
    - What it may change — its permissions (bot_permission), checked by
      the application; never more than its relationships allow.

  Employees:
    - Invite — any employee.
    - manager_id — the employee themselves (own profile). No confirmation
      from the manager: such a substitution is too noticeable.
    - Dismiss / bring back — the direct manager only. An employee with no
      manager cannot be dismissed (nobody dismisses themselves); a
      dismissed one always has a manager, and only that manager brings
      them back — under themselves: the employee then moves to another
      manager on their own.
    - Managers may form a ring (decision 90): directors who pick each
      other see all of each other''s tasks, like any manager. Rights stay
      with the direct manager: in a ring each dismisses and scores the
      one who picked them.
    - Someone at the top leaves in two steps of their own people: the
      leaver picks the successor as manager, the successor dismisses
      them (a successor among the leaver''s direct reports is left without
      a manager).
      Someone who will not: the installation administrator dismisses them
      with an heir (dismiss_with_heir, server/admin.ts) — outside the API.
    - Setting a manager notifies the new manager (new_report).

    - Deleting an attachment referenced by a comment or a task context.
    - reply_to_id pointing to a missing comment of the same task.

  Employees:
    - Deleting an employee (dismissal only).
    - An employee without the row of its kind, or with both (human, bot).
    - A bot with an email, without a manager, or managing anyone.
    - A bot with a timesheet, time entries, estimates, scores, reminders,
      visits, sessions or tag settings (they refer to human).


============================================================================
WHAT THE APPLICATION DOES ITSELF (not in the database)
============================================================================

  - Permission checks "owner only" / "manager only" for task operations
    (priority, tag_ids, context, owner_id, finished_at, dependency).
  - The "for oneself" check for estimate_minutes and remind.
  - Sanitizing the HTML of comment.value and task.context (an allow-list
    of tags; images only from the application''s own attachments) and
    filling comment.image_ids / task.context_image_ids from it.
  - A frontend warning "more time logged than in the timesheet".
  - Creating notifications through notify(): comment, mention, task
    attachment, owner change, score. Database functions create the rest.
  - Protection against accidental comment sending: after "Send" the
    comment stays in the interface for a few seconds with a "Back to
    editing" button and only then goes to the server.
  - Attachment deduplication: on upload, look for an attachment with the
    same hash and size and compare the bytes (or take one whose content
    was deleted); on a match return the existing id. The file name is stored in the comment
    (attachment_names), not in the attachment.
  - Notification delivery: the worker reads notification WHERE sent_at
    IS NULL (a finished_at_change only once deadline_settles() has
    passed since it was added), sends an email in the recipient''s language (SMTP from the
    config) and/or posts it to the webhook (URL and secret in the config,
    body signed with HMAC-SHA256), then sets sent_at = NOW().
  - The close_delay metric (delay in closing a shift) — on the frontend.
  - Rate limiting of issue_token: 5 links per employee in 15 minutes.

spent_minutes IS NULL — the shift is open (working right now).
An open shift lasts until infinity, so an employee has at most one open
shift and no shift can follow it.
The employee always closes the shift themselves, with whatever time
they consider right.
Shift end = started_at + spent_minutes. Shift day = local_day(started_at).
A shift belongs to that day alone: it ends by the following midnight, so it
is never longer than a day — work past midnight is a shift of the next day.
Shifts of one employee never overlap (EXCLUDE).
A shift cannot start in the future, nor end after the end of the current
minute: the timesheet is kept in whole minutes, so closing rounds the end
up — a shift closed at 17:59:40 ends at 18:00, and one started a moment
ago can be closed as one minute.

Any shift of a day without a standing score can be added, changed or
deleted, closed ones included, and a day may have several shifts. A
score freezes the day''s timesheet; the manager withdrawing the score
(score.value NULL) lets the employee correct it.

The close_delay metric (delay in closing a shift) is computed on the

(hashes may collide).
Reading an attachment: whoever uploaded or holds it, or whoever sees a
task whose comment or context refers to it (the application checks).
There is no file name here: the same file may arrive under different
names; the name is stored in comment.attachment_names.
Deduplication: on upload the application looks for a row with the same
hash and size and compares the bytes (or finds one whose content was
deleted); on a match it returns the existing id, puts the content back if
it was gone, and the uploader holds it (held_by).
Cron deletes, once a day, attachments nothing refers to

(uploaded, but the comment was never sent). An attachment in use cannot
be deleted (trigger) — comments live forever.

Storage is limited (decision 84), by the configuration, not the
database: a file at most so large; the files a person holds (held_by) at
most so much together, refused at upload or keep. Nothing deletes a
file''s content by its size or age: people let go of what they no longer
need when their quota runs out.
A file is kept while someone holds it: its uploaders, and whoever saw it
in a task and kept it (keep_attachment()) — a file handed to the one who
needs it stays theirs when its author lets it go. Letting a file go
(release_attachment()) takes it out of one''s quota; when nobody holds it
any more, its content is deleted. The row stays — who uploaded it, its
size, the names in comments — and value goes (purged_at): a link to it
says the file is gone. Anyone uploading the same bytes again (the same
