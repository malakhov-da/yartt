          q: 'Why is time logged in a shift?',
          a: 'A shift tells when a person worked, and an entry tells what that time went to. An entry without a shift can be '
            + 'neither checked nor scored, so each belongs to its shift and cannot exceed it. A task has one entry a shift: time '
            + 'is not counted twice by accident, and a correction is replacing the value.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Why can time be logged for past days?',
          a: 'A task is often written down after the work began, and a timesheet is filled in at the end of a day or a week. A ban '
            + 'would hit the honest. Late filling shows anyway: an entry has its date, My team shows how late the timesheet is '
            + 'written, and a scored shift can no longer change.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Why does an hour budget forbid nothing?',
          a: 'A budget is a guide: it helps notice in time that the work went off plan. An overrun shows in the plan dialog, before '
            + 'the hours are spent. A ban would not make the work smaller: the time would be logged elsewhere, and the figures would '
            + 'stop being true. What to spend hours on beyond a budget is for people to decide, not a counter.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Why does the tracker not pick the days to score, or require scoring?',
          a: 'The tracker is neither the employee\'s advocate nor the manager\'s supervisor. Scores are for finding where to grow, and someone who wants that needs no control: they pick random days themselves. Someone who does not will simply not score, whatever is checked. '
            + 'A dispute over a score is settled by talking, not by a setting.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Why are there no automatic penalties for a moved deadline?',
          a: 'A formula cannot tell bad luck from a week of nothing with the deadline moved afterwards. A penalty also pushes people to close what is not done to avoid it. So a moved deadline is talked over with the manager, who weighs it in the day\'s score. '
            + 'Experience counts too: the same work may score differently for a trainee and for a senior.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Why are shifts scored, and by what?',
          a: 'A task takes months and ten people: it is unclear whom to score and for what. A task\'s result depends on plans, '
            + 'colleagues and chance; the day\'s decisions depend on the person. So decisions are scored: were the priorities right, '
            + 'was help asked for in time, was nothing needless taken on. The manager writes a reason with every score, so scores '
            + 'do not slide into liking and disliking. A task may fail while the scores are good: then the plans are the problem, '
            + 'not the person. A manager usually gives all the shifts of a day one score at once, and scores them apart when '
            + 'the day went differently.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Why no metrics of estimate accuracy, deadline moves or priorities?',
          a: 'Such metrics teach people to play the tracker instead of working: rewarded for accurate estimates, they pad them; for '
            + 'few moves, they set deadlines with a margin; for many tasks, they split them. My team shows only what cannot be '
            + 'improved by working worse: the share of one\'s time in tasks, scores, reaction to mentions, how late the timesheet is '
            + 'written, whether the backlog grows. A deadline moved the day before is often honest: the task held more work than '
            + 'thought. A task may also be reopened by moving its deadline. So moves are not counted; what counts is whether a task '
            + 'closed by its deadline. A move made in advance is seen by the owners of the tasks waiting for it, and a task closed '
            + 'after its deadline passed shows to the manager in My team.',
        },
